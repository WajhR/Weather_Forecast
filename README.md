# Weather_Forecast

## Description

This is a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. It uses Third-party APIs to access the data and uses it in this dashboard. 

## Usage 
It was build to help travelers see the weather outlook for multiple cities

This project has helped me understand Third-party APIs and how to make requests with specific parameters to a URL.  I used the [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve weather data for cities.
